You are responsible for completing the following task. Decide for yourself how best to accomplish it.

Task: Build a "YouTube Course Creator" web app. The user pastes a YouTube playlist URL and gets a clean, distraction-free course page with progress tracking and per-lesson notes.

## Tech Stack

- **uv** for project management. Initialize with `uv init`, add dependencies with `uv add`. All commands should run through `uv run` (e.g., `uv run python main.py`).
- **FastHTML** (`from fasthtml.common import *`, `fast_app()`, HTMX-style partial updates). No React, no heavy JS frameworks.
- **yt-dlp** (Python library) for playlist metadata extraction. Extract titles, video IDs, thumbnails, and ordering — do not download any video files. No YouTube Data API key required.
- **SQLite** via FastHTML's built-in database support for all persistence.

## Features to Build

1. **Playlist input**: A home page with a single input field for a YouTube playlist URL. On submit, fetch playlist metadata via yt-dlp and redirect to the course page.

2. **Playlist metadata extraction**: Use yt-dlp to extract the playlist title and an ordered list of videos (title, video ID, thumbnail URL, duration). Cache the result in SQLite so repeat visits don't re-fetch.

3. **Course page layout**:
   - Left sidebar: ordered lesson list showing title, duration, and completion status. Clicking a lesson loads it in the main area.
   - Main area: YouTube embed player (iframe) for the selected lesson, lesson title, and a notes editor below.
   - The sidebar should highlight the current lesson and visually distinguish completed lessons.

4. **Completion tracking**: A "Mark complete" / "Mark incomplete" toggle per lesson. State persists in SQLite. The sidebar reflects completion status (e.g., checkmark icon or strikethrough).

5. **Per-lesson notes**: A textarea below the video player for freeform notes on the current lesson. Notes auto-save (on blur or via HTMX partial update) to SQLite. Notes persist across page reloads.

6. **Local persistence (SQLite)**: Three concerns stored locally:
   - Playlist cache (playlist URL → metadata, so yt-dlp isn't called again)
   - Lesson completion state (playlist + video → complete boolean)
   - Lesson notes (playlist + video → text)

## Out of Scope (Do Not Build)

- User accounts or authentication
- Shareable links or multi-user features
- Quizzes, certificates, or assessments
- AI-generated summaries or transcripts
- Analytics dashboards or progress charts

## Acceptance Criteria

The app is scored on 6 points (1 point each):

1. **Runs**: `uv run python main.py` starts the server with no errors, and the home page loads in a browser.
2. **Playlist fetch**: Pasting a valid YouTube playlist URL fetches metadata and displays the course page with all videos listed in order.
3. **Video playback**: Clicking a lesson in the sidebar loads the correct YouTube embed in the main area.
4. **Completion toggle**: Toggling a lesson's completion status persists across page reloads.
5. **Notes**: Writing a note for a lesson persists across page reloads.
6. **Playlist cache**: Visiting the same playlist URL a second time loads instantly from SQLite without calling yt-dlp again.

Before finishing, verify the app against every acceptance criterion and fix any failures.

## Deliverable

A working FastHTML application in this directory, managed by uv. At minimum: `main.py` (the app) and a `pyproject.toml` with dependencies (`python-fasthtml`, `yt-dlp`). Include a brief README.md with the startup command (`uv run python main.py`).
