  Key verification notes:
  - Only 1 email is individually confirmed from a primary source:

  - High-confidence emails (≥85% pattern match via RocketReach/LeadIQ/ZoomInfo)
  are included for o9, Caris, Securonix, Trintech, and Solera
  - All others use domain-inferred patterns — safe to use for outreach but
  should be validated before bulk sending
  - Spencer Rascoff listed as Executive Chairman at Match Group — verify current
   role (CEO is Bernard Kim as of 2022)
  - Sabre Hospitality Solutions email domain (@sabrehospitality.com) should be
  confirmed post-TPG acquisition
