You are responsible for completing the following task. Decide for yourself how best to accomplish it. 

Do your own research as needed (e.g., look up Shaw Talebi's YouTube, existing content, or landing page best practices) to write compelling copy and make informed design decisions.

Task: Design and build a landing page for "AI Builder Academy" — a self-paced program that teaches engineers and technical professionals how to design, build, and ship real AI applications end-to-end.

## Tech Stack

- **uv** for project management. Initialize with `uv init`, add dependencies with `uv add`. All commands should run through `uv run` (e.g., `uv run python main.py`).
- **FastHTML** (`from fasthtml.common import *`, `fast_app()`, HTMX-style partial updates). No React, no heavy JS frameworks.
- Custom CSS for styling (inline or a static CSS file). No Tailwind or CSS frameworks.

## Brand Guidelines

**Colors**:
- Primary: `#287ca7` (blue — CTAs, links, key accents)
- Secondary: `#b70d0a` (red — urgency, highlights)
- Accent: `#8fc93b` (green — success, checkmarks, positive callouts)
- Neutral: `#1b273a` (dark navy — text, headings on light backgrounds)
- Background: `#000000` (black — page background)
- Content: `#fafffd` (near-white — body text on dark backgrounds)

**Fonts** (load from Google Fonts):
- Headers: **Manrope** (weight 600–800)
- Body: **Libre Franklin** (weight 400–500)

## Program Context (use for copy)

**Core transformation**: AI user → AI builder. Students move from using tools like ChatGPT to building production-style AI systems.

**Target audience**: Engineers and technical professionals who are more than an AI user but not yet an AI engineer — builders in the middle.

**What students learn** (syllabus topics):
1. LLM foundations and prompt engineering
2. Retrieval, RAG, and vector search
3. AI agents and tool use (MCP / workflows)
4. Evaluating and improving AI systems
5. Designing AI system architectures
6. Building end-to-end AI applications
7. Deploying and shipping AI apps

**Capstone**: Students complete a capstone AI project they can demonstrate publicly (portfolio-level artifact).

**Teaching philosophy**: First-principles explanations + plain language + hands-on building.

**Value proposition**: Increase impact in current role, transition into AI engineering work, or build AI products.

**Instructor — Shaw Talebi**:
- AI educator and builder with 100k+ learners across YouTube and courses
- Former data scientist (Toyota) with ~8 years in AI
- PhD background
- Founder of AI Builders Bootcamp (live cohort program)
- Known for clear explanations and real-world projects

## Design Requirements

- Dark theme (black background, light text) — modern, tech-forward feel.
- Mobile-responsive (page should work on both desktop and mobile viewports).
- **Waitlist CTA**: Embed a Kit (ConvertKit) form using this script tag wherever the waitlist signup should appear:
  `<script async data-uid="fa5023cefd" src="https://the-data-entrepreneurs.kit.com/fa5023cefd/index.js"></script>`
  Use FastHTML's `NotStr()` or `Script()` to render this in the page. The form handles its own styling and submission — do not build a custom email input or form around it.
- Use a placeholder image path (`/static/instructor.jpg`) for the instructor photo — create a gray placeholder div if the image doesn't exist.
- You decide the page structure, section ordering, and layout. Design it like a real landing page that converts.

## Out of Scope (Do Not Build)

- Payment processing or real checkout
- User accounts or authentication
- Blog, FAQ, or multi-page navigation
- Analytics or tracking scripts
- Custom email collection forms (the Kit embed handles this)

## Acceptance Criteria

The page is scored on 6 points (1 point each):

1. **Runs**: `uv run python main.py` starts the server with no errors, and the landing page loads in a browser.
2. **Brand compliance**: Page uses the specified colors and fonts (Manrope headers, Libre Franklin body, dark background, correct color palette).
3. **Compelling copy**: Headlines and body text are specific to AI Builder Academy (not generic lorem ipsum). Copy communicates the transformation, audience, and value.
4. **Waitlist CTA**: The Kit embed script is present in the rendered HTML and the form loads visibly on the page.
5. **Responsive**: The page is usable on both desktop (~1200px) and mobile (~375px) viewports without horizontal scrolling or overlapping elements.
6. **Visual polish**: Clear hierarchy, consistent spacing, readable typography, and a design that looks like a real product landing page.

Before finishing, verify the app against every acceptance criterion and fix any failures.

## Deliverable

A working FastHTML landing page in this directory, managed by uv. At minimum: `main.py` (the app), a `pyproject.toml` with dependencies (`python-fasthtml`), and any static assets (CSS file, placeholder images). Include a brief README.md with the startup command (`uv run python main.py`).
